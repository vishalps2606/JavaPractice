In this repository, I will push the codes that I will find helpful for the CSE persons, so that they can learn the things.

### Ques1 Problem Statement
Write a program to return those elements of the array those sum is equal to 0.
Input - arr = [-1, -2, 3, 4, 11]
Output - -1 -2 3

### Ques2 Problem Statement
The car service station caters to different types of cars – Hatchback, Sedan, SUV.
It provides different types of services like Basic Service, Engine Fixing, Clutch Fixing, Gear Fixing and Brake Fixing.
Each service has a service code associated with it and different prices for different types of cars.
 
 Service Code     Service         Hatchback  Sedan   SUV
 BS01             Basic Servicing ₹ 2000     ₹ 4000  ₹ 5000
 EF01             Engine Fixing   ₹ 5000     ₹ 8000  ₹ 10000
 CF01             Clutch Fixing   ₹ 2000     ₹ 4000  ₹ 6000
 BF01             Brake Fixing    ₹ 1000     ₹ 1500  ₹ 2500
 GF01             Gear Fixing     ₹ 3000     ₹ 6000  ₹ 8000

 The software should generate a detailed bill with the total amount for each service request based on the Type of
 Car specified and the requested Service Codes.
 
 Example:
 Type of Car – Hatchback
 Service Codes – BS01, EF01
 Charges for Basic Servicing – ₹ 2000
 Charges for Engine Fixing – ₹ 5000
 Total Bill – ₹ 7000
 
 In addition, if the total service bill is more than ₹ 10000, a complimentary cleaning should be provided and specified in the bill.
 
 ### Ques 3 Problem Statement
 
 write a program to shuffle the integers of an array in the form of this formula
    a1 <= a2 >= a3 <= a4 >= a5 ...

Input - arr = [2,1,5,3,11,7]
Output - [1, 5, 2, 7, 3, 11]
